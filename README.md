# Learning ReactJS

This project is a slightly altered copy of its respectable owner's Yauhen Kavalchuk [repository](https://github.com/YauhenKavalchuk/react-js-tutorial). The goal was to learn ReactJS by watching his youtube lessons, study official documentation and then try to reproduce code from those lessons, until it works as it should work.

The author of this repository also wanted to practice git skills, such as but not limited to: `git checkout`, `git branch some_new_feature`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git merge`, `git push` and so on.

As the result of building this project, the author learned how to:
- create components
- distinct stateful components from stateless ones
- manage state of a class component
- pass data to nested components using props
- validate props using prop-types
- add event listeners
- use conditional rendering
- render multiple adjacent elements and components
- add styles
- create forms and form elements
- properly use component's lifecycle methods
- add refs
- wrap components into higher order components
- create portals outside root element
- use context to pass props to deeply nested children (escape 'props drilling')
- fetch data from third-party API ([Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api))
- set up routing to turn app into a basic SPA
- create redux store, make own reducers and actions
- and finally create a TODO list to consolidate knowledge gained so far
